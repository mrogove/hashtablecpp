Node
(constructors)
(get basics from Lab4)

funcs:
get next
get prior?
set next
set prior?

structure:
- word (string)
- freq (int)
- hash value (int?)
- pointer to next
- pointer to prior?


HashTable
(constructors)
needs loadcalc.
- needs a Convert() func that takes word and freq, creates new Node, calculates hashval. Invokes add() to current table.

Add() should also check load value and invoke resize if necessary.
get(), word-based.
remove(), word-based. Should be bool.

priv structure:
- array of pointers to LinkedLists.
- load values
	- number of elements
	- array size
needs resize function based on load.
	- resize can leverage add() (to new), as well as the LinkedList removeFront() (from old) functions.



Hasher
should take word as input
should return an int value?
